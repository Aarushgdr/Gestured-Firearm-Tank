project: Gestured Firearm Tank

## Summary

I will make a gesture controlled tank that will move according to the gesture of the hand.For example- Whenever I will move my hand down, tank will automatically move 
forward. The same car will also have a weapon gun. Whenever I will make a particular hand gun gesture, it will automatically shoot orbeez from the muzzle of the gun.
I am so excited to work upon this project beacause it was my childhood dream to make a tank with gun on it and it will operate on my hand gestures.

## Plan

I already have creality ender 3 3d printer at my house. I will 3d print the tank with gun on it. After that, I will attach the wheels to the tank. Then I will connect 
RF Module to the tank for the communications between the tank and the gesture that will be made. I will also use ADXL335 module to measure the acceleration force. I  
will connect the motors to the motor driver and the motor driver to the arduino uno and afterwards i will connect the sensors to the arduino. I will complete my whole 
circuit on pcb double sided board with the help of arduino. Moreover, I will complete the coding and the gestured firearm tank will be ready!

Firstly, I will 3d print the tank with the firearm.
Secondly, I will attach the wheels to the tank.
Thirdly, I will connect RF Module for communications and the ADXL335 module to measure the acceleration force.
Fourthly, I will connect the motors to the motor driver and the motor driver to the arduino uno and afterwards i will connect the sensors to the arduino.
Fifthly, I will use pcb double sided board to complete circuit.
Lastly, With the help of Arduino Uno, I will complete circuit and the coding.

## Budget

What materials will you need for your project? Where will you get them? How much does it cost? Please include all materials, including components you already own. Make sure to factor in shipping costs and sales tax.
